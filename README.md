# MultiSnake
This is a "multiplayer" snake game where one snake moves around multiple
computers. It was written more as a challenge rather than a real game
(and I admit the game probably gets old once the novelty wears off).

I think I wrote this in a week around June 2011 (late on in my first year
of sixth form). It brings back memories of watching the entire class play it :)
